	Chapter 1
	</h1>

	<p>
	Molly had been staring out of her window for about now. On  her desk, lyingn between the copies of <i> Nature. New Scienst, </i> and all the other<br>
	scientific journals her work had appeared  in, was a well thumbed copy of <i> On The Road.</i> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she <br>
	spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have<br>
	nothing  better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of IIama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly<br>
	<em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
